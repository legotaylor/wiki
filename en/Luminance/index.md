# Features  
- **Adds Dynamic Shader Uniforms**  
    - These let post-processing shaders have more information about what's happening in-game.  
    - Luminance comes with a bunch of these by default, but you can add your own too!  
- **Adds shaders that have been used in previous minecraft versions.**  
    - _Requires [Perspective](https://modrinth.com/mod/mclegoman-perspective) or [Souper Secret Settings](https://modrinth.com/mod/souper-secret-settings)._  
    - Luminance takes care of rendering shaders, so you don't have to!  
    - You can check if Iris Shaders are enabled using Luminance.  
        - This means you don't have to have Iris added to your development environment!  
    - You can replace your ModMenu icon using Luminance!  
        - Make your mod icon change depending on the time of year, or via a config option, anything's possible!
