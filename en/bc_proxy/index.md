As time goes on, Mojang updates their apis, and with newer hardware and system updates, issues arise.  
Luckily, the community has created ways to fix some of these problems.  

You can fix skins, sounds, and some crashes, by using the Betacraft Proxy (you don't need the launcher to use the proxy!).  
To use this proxy, add the following to your JVM arguments: `-Dhttp.proxyHost=betacraft.uk`  

It's also recommended to use the following JVM argument for older versions of Minecraft: `-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true`
