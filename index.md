If you are looking to contribute, you can create a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/legotaylor/wiki). If you are looking to help translate the wiki, open a PR on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/legotaylor/wiki). We don't have any documentation for translating at the moment, however we use the [polyglot](https://polyglot.untra.io/) Jekyll plugin, and you will need to update the [config](https://github.com/legotaylor/wiki/blob/main/_config.yml) if you're adding a new language.
